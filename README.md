# SteamDown
Swiping down pushes Shift + Tab on keyboard. 

Swping down from the top down (10 pixels) will activate keys "Shift + Tab". If you open the code and save it locally and have Visual Studio Code locally on your PC you can run csc "KeySwipe.cs" to built it or download and run the KeySwipe.exe to make it work.
